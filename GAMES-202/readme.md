# GAMES202 - Notes, Assignments and Projects

## Introduction to This Course

GAMES202 (2021-03), or **Real-Time High Quality Rendering**, is an open course in computer graphics conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan. The course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental problems appeared in the field of real-time rendering and their corresponding solutions. As real-time rendering demands high speed (>30 FPS), the course focuses on breaking the trade-off between speed and quality within stringent time constraints, while ensuring both **real-time high speed** and **photorealism**. A number of cutting-edge topics in academia and industry will be covered, including soft shadow rendering, environmental lighting, global illumination techniques (both precomputation-based and without precomputation), physically-based shading models and methods, real-time ray tracing, anti-aliasing, supersampling, and common techniques for acceleration .
