## Introduction to This Course

GAMES202 (2021-03), or **Real-Time High Quality Rendering**, is an open course in computer graphics conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan. The course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental problems appeared in the field of real-time rendering and their corresponding solutions. 

As real-time rendering demands high speed (>30 FPS), the course focuses on breaking the trade-off between speed and quality within stringent time constraints, while ensuring both **real-time high speed** and **photorealism**. A number of cutting-edge topics in academia and industry will be covered, including:

- Soft Shadow Rendering, 
- Environmental Lighting, 
- Global Illumination Techniques (both precomputation-based and without precomputation), 
  - Interactive Global Illumination, ...
- Physically-Based Shading Models and Methods, 
- Real-time Ray Tracing, 
- Anti-Aliasing, 
- Supersampling, and 
- Common Techniques for Acceleration.
