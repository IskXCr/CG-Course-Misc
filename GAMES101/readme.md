# GAMES101 - Assignments and Projects

This repository contains my assignments and projects for GAMES101 conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan. 

According to the policy listed in the slide of the first week, this public repository is only uploaded for educational/referential usages and discussions. Since this course have been published for 2 years (speaking of year 2023), I decided to track my personal progress using this public GitHub repository. The advantage of using a public Git repo is that it makes discussions among those CG enthusiasts easier.

It is VIOLATING THE POLICY specified in GAMES101 to directly copy these referential materials and use as a student's own solution without having them walked through by itself first.
