# GAMES101 - Notes, Assignments and Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains my notes, assignments and projects for GAMES101 conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan. 

The purpose of this repository is to track personal progress.

According to the policy listed in the slide of the first week, this public repository is only uploaded for educational/referential usages and discussions.

It is VIOLATING THE POLICY specified in GAMES101 to directly copy these referential materials and use as a student's own solution without having them walked through by itself first.
