## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of assignments and projects from various courses in computer graphics.

The current list is as follows. 

In each course, if there is a course project, the project constitutes 33% of the entire progress.

For detailed information about a specific course listed above, please read the `readme.md` file contained in corresponding repository. Answers (not limited to) these problems are included **in English**:

- What is the content of the course?
- If there are any notes?
- What are the assignments, what has been already provided inside the framework for assignments, and what have we implemented?
- What is the course project about? What's our choice about the topic and what have we implemented?
- What are your demos for this course, if any?

For copyright information, please also consult the readme document.



## Course Repositories

### Courses

At the root level, you will find the folders associated with each specific course. Within each folder a `readme.md` file provides an introduction to that course, related information (such as copyright disclaimer) and selected demos made by us.

### Assignments and Projects

For each course, a single section about the content of all assignments and project is provided.

For each assignment/project within a given course, a corresponding `readme.md` file in the assignment folder provides a brief description of the author's implementation, along with a few accompanying images for demonstration purposes. For some topics, we provide references on which the implementation is based and *link to the note* where we have written a compact introduction on this particular topic.

## Selected Demos

Currently there is none :(
