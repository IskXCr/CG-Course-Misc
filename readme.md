## Course Repositories

### Courses

At the root level, you will find the folders associated with each specific course. Within each folder a `readme.md` file provides an introduction to that course, related information (such as copyright disclaimer) and selected demos made by us.

### Assignments

For each course, a single section about the content of all assignments and project is provided.

For each assignment/project within a given course, a corresponding `readme.md` file in the assignment folder provides a brief description of the author's implementation, along with a few accompanying images for demonstration purposes. For some topics, we provide references on which the implementation is based and *link to the note* where we have written a compact introduction on this particular topic.

## Selected Demos

Currently there is none :(
